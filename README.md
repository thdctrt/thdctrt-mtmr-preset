- Advanced preset with Smart Home controls
- Thanks to [@bobrosoft](https://github.com/bobrosoft) for [Spotify script](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR-presets/blob/master/bobrosoft)

*Features*

*How To*
- Install NoiseBuddy: https://github.com/insidegui/NoiseBuddy
- Install iStats: https://github.com/Chris911/iStats
- Create /Users/Shared/MTMR/ older and drop there `spotify.scpt`
- Of course, add `items.json` as MTMR preset
- Set up NoiseBuddy shortcut on `⌃ ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ + {` as [shown here](/noisebuddy-settings.png) (the main idea is to use a hotkey you won't definitely ever need, if you want to change it, don't forget to tweak it in preset as well)
- In order to use Timer function, you need to add Start Timer Shortcut to your Shortcuts by lauching it.
